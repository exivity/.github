# How to contribute

**For contributors to our open source projects**  
We're not at the scale where we have a full code of conduct or community guidelines. In general, please keep our community approachable and respectable.

**For internal teams**  
Please read the Exivity [collaboration guide](https://app.gitbook.com/@exivity/s/docs/product/collaboration-guide) on GitBook.
